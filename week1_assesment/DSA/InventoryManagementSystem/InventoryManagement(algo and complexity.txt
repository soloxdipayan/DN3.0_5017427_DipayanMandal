1) why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.

        Efficient data structures and algorithms are crucial for handling large inventories because they:

. Optimize Performance: Ensure fast data retrieval, insertion, and deletion, which is essential for real-time inventory management.

. Reduce Complexity: Simplify the implementation of complex operations, making the system easier to maintain and scale.

. Enhance Scalability: Allow the system to handle growing amounts of data without significant performance degradation.



2) Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.
    HashMap: Ideal for key-value pairs, offering average O(1) time complexity for insertions, deletions, and lookups. Suitable for scenarios where quick access to elements is required for a large inventories.





3) Analysis of Time Complexity
    Add Product (addProduct):           Time Complexity: O(1)
    Update Product (updateProduct):     Time Complexity: O(1)    
    Delete Product (deleteProduct):     Time Complexity: O(1)
    Display Products (displayProducts): Time Complexity: O(n) [Iterating through all the values in the HashMap to display the products requires O(n) time, where n is the number of products in the inventory.]
