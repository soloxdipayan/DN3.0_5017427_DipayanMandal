1)  Explain Big O notation and how it helps in analyzing algorithms.
    
    Big O notation describes the upper bound of the time complexity of an algorithm, providing an approximation of the worst-case scenario as the input size grows. 
    It helps in understanding how the runtime of an algorithm scales with the size of the input.


2) Describe the best, average, and worst-case scenarios for search operations.
    
    Best-Case Scenario: The scenario where the algorithm performs the fewest operations. For example, in a search operation, finding the desired element on the first try.
    
    Average-Case Scenario: The expected scenario where the algorithm performs an average number of operations across all possible inputs.
    
    Worst-Case Scenario: The scenario where the algorithm performs the maximum number of operations. This is often the focus in Big O analysis, as it provides an upper bound on performance.



3) Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search algorithms.

    Linear Search:

Best-Case: O(1) — The target is the first element.
Average-Case: O(n) — On average, half the array is checked.
Worst-Case: O(n) — The target is the last element or not present.

    Binary Search:

Best-Case: O(1) — The target is the middle element.
Average-Case: O(log n) — The array is repeatedly halved.
Worst-Case: O(log n) — The target is at the extreme ends or not present.



4) Discuss which algorithm is more suitable for your platform and why.

    Linear Search: Suitable for small datasets or unsorted arrays.
    Binary Search: More suitable for large datasets where the array is sorted, as it significantly reduces the number of comparisons needed.
